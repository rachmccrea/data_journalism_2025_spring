hi! i'm working in R and the tidyverse and trying to join two datasets by a shared GEOID column. I keep getting an error message that object 'GEOID' is not found. Here's my code, do you know what I'm doing wrong? 
joined_senate_gov <- gov_2018 %>% 
  left_join(md_senate_county, GEOID==GEOID)

Response:
Hello! It looks like you're trying to join two datasets using the `left_join` function from the **tidyverse**, but there's a small mistake in your syntax. In the `left_join` function, you should specify the joining keys using the `by` argument. 

Here's how you can correct your code:

```r
joined_senate_gov <- gov_2018 %>% 
  left_join(md_senate_county, by = "GEOID")
```

### Explanation:
- **`by = "GEOID"`**: This specifies that you want to join the two datasets using the `GEOID` column. Make sure that both datasets (`gov_2018` and `md_senate_county`) contain a column named `GEOID`.

### Additional Tips:
- **Check Column Names**: Ensure that the `GEOID` column exists in both datasets. You can check the column names using `colnames(gov_2018)` and `colnames(md_senate_county)`.
- **Case Sensitivity**: R is case-sensitive, so make sure the column name matches exactly (e.g., `GEOID` vs. `geoid`).

Try this adjustment, and let me know if you encounter any further issues or if you need additional help!

that worked, i see what I did wrong!

I'm running into trouble trying to use mutate(), though. I want to add columns with county totals, but keep getting an error message that it's an invalid type of argument. here's my code: 

Response:
I'm glad the join issue was resolved! Now, let's address the `mutate()` problem you're encountering. The error message you're seeing, "invalid type of argument," often occurs when you're trying to perform operations on incompatible data types or when the syntax is not correct.

To help you better, could you please provide the code you're using with `mutate()`? This way, I can identify the exact issue and guide you on how to fix it. 

In the meantime, hereâ€™s a general structure for using `mutate()` to add new columns:

### Basic Structure of `mutate()`
```r
library(dplyr)

new_data <- existing_data %>%
  mutate(new_column_name = some_operation(existing_column))
```

### Example
If you want to calculate county totals based on an existing column, it might look something like this:

```r
new_data <- existing_data %>%
  group_by(county_column) %>%
  mutate(county_total = sum(existing_column, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Please share your specific `mutate()` code, and I'll help you troubleshoot it!

joined_senate_gov <- joined_senate_gov %>% 
  group_by(GEOID)
  mutate(hogan18_total = sum('Hogan.x', 'Jealous', 'Quinn', 'Schlakman', 'Write-ins'), hogansenate_total = sum('Hogan.y', 'Alsobrooks', 'Scott'))



Response:
Thank you for sharing your code! I see a couple of issues that could be causing the error with your `mutate()` function:

1. **Incorrect Use of Quotes**: When referencing column names within `mutate()`, you should not use quotes. Using quotes will treat the column names as strings rather than as variable names.
  
2. **Syntax Error**: After the `group_by()` function, you need to ensure that the `mutate()` function is part of the pipeline. You can do this by placing the `mutate()` function on the same line or using the `%>%` operator to continue the pipeline.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```r
joined_senate_gov <- joined_senate_gov %>% 
  group_by(GEOID) %>% 
  mutate(
    hogan18_total = sum(Hogan.x, Jealous, Quinn, Schlakman, `Write-ins`, na.rm = TRUE),
    hogansenate_total = sum(Hogan.y, Alsobrooks, Scott, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

### Key Changes:
- **Removed Quotes**: The column names are now referenced without quotes.
- **Used Backticks for Spaces**: If any column names contain spaces (like `Write-ins`), use backticks (`` ` ``) around them.
- **Added `na.rm = TRUE`**: This argument will ensure that any `NA` values are ignored in the sum calculations.

### Additional Notes:
- If you want to calculate totals for each group defined by `GEOID`, make sure that the columns you're summing are numeric. If they are not, you may need to convert them to numeric first.

Try this updated code, and let me know if it resolves the issue or if you need further assistance!
